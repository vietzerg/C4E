### 1. How to check a variable’s type?

Use Python's function `type`, for example:
	
	type(variable_a)

### 2. In what cases, you will get SyntaxError from the compiler telling you that some of your variables have invalid names? Can you give 3 different examples of invalid names?
	
* The variable name does not begin with a letter, for example: `123abc`.
* The variable name is one of the Python keywords, for example: `and`.
* The varialble name contains an illegal character, for example: `dollar$`.
